Display only the post or page content, without a theme, sidebars, scripts or stylesheets.

== Description ==

Enables you to show only a post or page's content, without sidebars, footers, and other content.

There are many different reasons for wanting to show just the content, but there's never been such an easy way to do it. This plugin adds a box in the post and page editor that provides you with four links:

* Content Only
* Content with Tags
* Content with Categories
* Content with Categories & Tags

This is very helpful in conjunction with the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" rel="nofollow">Google Keyword Tool</a>, so that Google only analyses the content of your post or page, not the surrounding context as well.
